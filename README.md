# Automated Monitoring and Real-Time Alert System for Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLR)

## 📌 Overview
The **Automated Monitoring and Real-Time Alert System for Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLR)** is designed to enhance water resource management by providing **continuous monitoring**, **data logging**, and **instant alerts** for critical water level changes.  
This system automates the process of collecting water level data, analyzing it, and notifying relevant authorities in real time — enabling faster decision-making during flood situations or abnormal water variations.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Acquisition** from DWLR sensors.
- **Automated Data Logging** for historical analysis.
- **Threshold-Based Alerts** via SMS/Email when water levels exceed safe limits.
- **Web Dashboard** for live monitoring and data visualization.
- **Cloud Integration** for remote access and scalability.
- **Customizable Alert Levels** for different locations and conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Digital Water Level Recorder (DWLR) with telemetry unit
- **Backend**: Python / Flask
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js for graphs)
- **APIs**: Twilio / SMTP for alerts
- **Hosting**: AWS / GCP

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: DWLR sensors measure water levels and transmit readings to the backend.
2. **Data Processing**: The backend processes readings and compares them against predefined thresholds.
3. **Alert Triggering**: If a threshold is crossed, SMS/Email alerts are sent to stakeholders.
4. **Visualization**: Data is displayed in real-time on the dashboard, with historical trends.
5. **Logging**: All readings are stored in the database for long-term analysis.

## 📊 Use Cases
- Flood monitoring and early warning systems.
- Reservoir and dam water level management.
- Irrigation water level tracking.
- Industrial water management systems.
